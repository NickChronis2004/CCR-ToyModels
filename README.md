Numerical code accompanying the paper:

**"Conditional Cosmological Recurrence in Finite Hilbert Spaces and Holographic Bounds within Causal Patches"**

by N. Chronis and N. Sifakis, *Universe* (2025)

## Description

This repository contains Python scripts for the toy model simulations 
demonstrating quantum recurrence in finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- NumPy
- SciPy

## Usage
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python toy_models.py
```

> **Reproducibility Note:** Please note that individual realizations of the random matrices (GOE/GUE) will vary. While the exact curves in the figures may differ from the manuscript due to different random seeds or parameter adjustments, the statistical scaling laws and qualitative behaviors remain robust.
